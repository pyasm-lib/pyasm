# PyASM
*An advanced and easy-to-use Python library used to generate functionnals Assembly programs from Python code.*

## What is PyASM?
PyASM is an advanced and easy-to-use Python library. It is designed to generate Assembly programs from Python code.
Well, not exactly.
The library contains a lot of functions which generates Assembly code when they are called. All the generated code
is written into a `.asm` file that you can run.

## Why should you use PyASM?
You want to make very low level programs but you don't want how to do? You want to say to your friends that you are
an Assembly professionnal by showing them the code generated by PyASM? You want to write an entire OS in Python?
This is possible with this library.
Anything other?

## How to use it?
Actually, there is no special install. You must download the source code (fortunately, if you are reading this
README, you probably found it).

If you don't have `git` installed:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Next, clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyasm-lib/pyasm
```

And put the files in your PYTHONPATH.
